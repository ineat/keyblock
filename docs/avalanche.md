# Connect to Avalanche network

## Avalanche

Avalanche is a blockchain separated from Ethereum but that runs an Ethereum Virtual Machine.

Solidity smart contracts can be deployed as on Ethereum without any change.

## Setup Avalanche connexion in Metamask

- Go to https://chainlist.org/
- Click on **Connect wallet** to connect Metamask
- In search form, enter **avalanche** and activate **Testnets** switch.
- Look for **Avalanche Fuji Testnet**, this is the Avalanche testnet. Click on **Add to Metamask** and follow instructions.

The Avalanche **Fuji** testnet is now connected to Metamask. 

**Your Avalanche/Fuji address and private key are the same as on Ethereum networks.**

## Use Fuji testnet

First, on Metamask, switch network to Avalanche Fuji.

Then, we need some AVAX, the Avalanche cryptocurrency, to pay transaction fees. 
- Got to faucet https://faucet.avax.network/
- Paste wallet address and submit
