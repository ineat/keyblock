# Connect to Polygon network

## Polygon

Polygon is an Ethereum layer 2 chain. It uses the technology of Optimistic Rollups to accelerate work on Ethereum.

It gathers job from several sources, users ... and group all the results in a single transaction that will be written on Ethereum chain.

Fees are then cheaper and scalability is better.

Solidity smart contracts can be deployed as on Ethereum without any change.

## Setup Polygon connexion in Metamask

- Go to https://chainlist.org/
- Click on **Connect wallet** to connect Metamask
- In search form, enter **polygon** and activate **Testnets** switch.
- Look for **Mumbai**, this is the Polygon testnet. Click on **Add to Metamask** and follow instructions.

The Polygon **Mumbai** testnet is now connected to Metamask. 

**Your Polygon/Mumbai address and private key are the same as on Ethereum networks.**

## Use Mumbai testnet

First, on Metamask, switch network to Mumbai.

Then, we need some MATIC, the Polygon cryptocurrency, to pay transaction fees. 
- Got to faucet https://faucet.polygon.technology/
- Select **Mumbai** network
- Select token **MATIC token**
- Paste wallet address, submit and confirm
